# Retail sales from 2010
Our overall goal for this project is to explore the relationship between the columns IsHoliday and Weekly_Sales. Moreover, we were interested in seeing how Store, Dept, Type, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment separately affected this relationship. We wanted to ask questions such as, "What will weekly sales look like if it's a holiday or not a holiday for each store or department?" We aimed to look for any trends and correlations between sales and holidays, and between sales and holidays given a third variable.

We analyze the data for four holiday days which consist of Labor day, Christmas, Super Bowl and Thanksgiving. In conclusion, while we did see that there were peaks in sales corresponding to certain holidays, we wanted to explore this further than plotting IsHoliday and Weekly Sales. We saw some variations in weekly sales based on departments and stores. Moreover, we saw that type C had the smallest difference between weekly sales during holidays and non holidays while types A and B had bigger differences. Overall we found that holidays do have an effect on retail sales for most stores and departments. However, for some stores and departments, that effect was less noticeable. The winter holidays of Thanksgiving and Christmas had the largest impact on weekly sales. We saw that unemployment, CPI, fuel price, and temperature had little effect on weekly sales based on whether or not it was a holiday.
